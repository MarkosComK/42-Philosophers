	üöÄ This project consists of coding basic C functions (see below), which are then compiled
	into a library for use in other projects of the cursus.


## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Requirements

The library is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the philo**

To compile the philo, run:

```shell
$ cd path/to/philo && make
```

## üìã Testing

**1. I haven`t coded a tester yet, but you can make your own test for each function. Here some third party testers that you can use.**

### Third-party testers

* [Philosphers-42Project-Tester](https://github.com/newlinuxbot/Philosphers-42Project-Tester)
